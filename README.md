# Static service pages

This is a repository of static pages used in digital services developed by the Environment Agency and its partners.

These pages are intended for use when a service is down due to maintenance or technical issues.

## Viewing the pages

In order to view the pages they do need to be served by a web service. If you are using a Mac or have a version of Linux installed you should have everything you need already installed.

### Starting the web server

Open a terminal and navigate to the root of the project. Then run;

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Open your browser and go to http://0.0.0.0:4000. You'll see a directory listing of all the files and folders in the root of the project. Simply click the link for *html* page you wish to see.
