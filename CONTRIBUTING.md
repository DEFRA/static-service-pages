# Contributing

This project is used by multiple services. Check with the technical leads for those services before amended any existing assets or pages. If you are unsure who they are, or unsure about working with this project, contact [Ben Sagar](https://github.com/bensagar-ea) or [Alan Cruikshanks](https://github.com/Cruikshanks).

All contributions should be submitted on a pull request and follow the process outlined in [DST-guides](https://github.com/DEFRA/dst-guides/blob/master/process/pull_request.md).

## Adding new pages

If you are just adding new pages, there is little risk to existing services so go right ahead. However stick to the following conventions.

- Place front office pages in the [/front-office](/front-office) folder
- Place back office pages in the [/back-office](/back-office) folder
- Name your pages using the pattern [service acronym]-[back or front office]-[type of page].html e.g. [frae-fo-maintenance.html](/front-office/frae-fo-maintenance.html)
- Update the [index.html](/index.html) in the root of the folder with links to your new pages


If your service requires you to break one of these conventions though, don't be afraid to do so. Explain the reason why in the PR and document the reason here.
